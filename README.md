# The Report

The Report and my findings 

Bugs:
1. No validation for name (important)
2. Drag and drop files page is missing the title and instuctions
3.Date in (MM-DD-YYYY) this is not a european date format
4.The first option of the security questions is empty
5. You can submit the form by just choosing a security question only. 


Improvements
1. When you eneter the site, the fist button is "Next"  this should be "Enter"
2. Signature page is missing instructions 
3. The footer on security questions should be "your answer/response"
4. There need some validations on all pages!
